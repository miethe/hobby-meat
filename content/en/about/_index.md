Hi! I'm Nick Miethe (Me-T, or Meaty), and I'm the aforementioned Hobbyist.

<h1 class="text-center">Consultant/Architect/Engineer by Day</h1>

<p class="lead mt-5 text-center"> I am currently an Associate Partner and Executive Architect at BoxBoat, a small DevOps/Kubernetes consultancy that was recently acquired by IBM Consulting. At IBM, I lead the OpenShift Practice, engage in pre-sales, help lead the Red Hat Alliance, and occasionally assist with solutioning for complex architectures, especially around OpenShift.
</p>
<p class="lead mt-5 text-center"> My background is in Software Engineering, Network Engineering, and DevOps. My favorite programming language has always been Python, despite rarely getting an opportunity to write code these days.

<h1 class="text-center">Hobbyist at Heart</h1>

<p class="lead mt-5 text-center"> If you haven't yet guessed, I'm an avid hobbyist. Somehow, it wasn't apparent that I have fairly extreme ADHD (mostly without the H) until well into my career. But now that I know, it all makes much more sense!
</p>
<p class="lead mt-5 text-center"> In addition to my hobbies, I'm also a (hopefully) decent husband, and proud father of 2 young girls and 2 puppies!
